                        <p> A bug tracking system or defect tracking system is a software application that keeps track
                            of
                            reported software
                            bugs
                            in software development projects. It may be regarded as a type of issue tracking system.
                            Many bug
                            tracking
                            systems,
                            such as those used by most open source software projects, allow end-users to enter bug
                            reports
                            directly Other
                            systems are used only internally in a company or organization doing software development.
                            Typically
                            bug tracking
                            systems are integrated with other software project management applications. A bug tracking
                            system is
                            usually a
                            necessary component of a good software development infrastructure, and consistent use of a
                            bug or
                            issue tracking
                            system is considered one of the "hallmarks of a good software team.
                            A major component of a bug tracking system is a database that records facts about known
                            bugs. Facts
                            may include
                            the time a bug was reported, its severity, the erroneous program behavior, and details on
                            how to
                            reproduce the
                            bug; as well as the identity of the person who reported it and any programmers who may be
                            working on
                            fixing it.

                            Typical bug tracking systems support the concept of the life cycle for a bug which is
                            tracked
                            through the status
                            assigned to the bug. A bug tracking system should allow administrators to configure
                            permissions
                            based on status,
                            move the bug to another status, or delete the bug. The system should also allow
                            administrators to
                            configure the
                            bug statuses and to what extent a bug in a particular status can be moved. Some systems will
                            e-mail
                            interested
                            parties, such as the submitter and assigned programmers, when new records are added or the
                            status
                            changes.
